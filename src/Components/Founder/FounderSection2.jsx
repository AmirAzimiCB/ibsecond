          “When I was little I used to dream I could change what I saw happening
          in my community… what my neighborhood was going through. I hated the
          narrative used to describe my home; what we would now consider to be
          “expected” cultural canon. My passion, my activism, everything that
          translates into my journalism, ever since I can remember, came as a
          reflex out of forced circumstances. Seeing little-to-no authentic
          representational viewpoints of Black women in the media, coupled with
          agenda-based narrative, forced upon the Black community, as a whole,
          within the news. That’s something I constantly work toward changing…
          it’s definitely one of my top career and life goals. For me, it’s more
          than trying to “objectify” the struggle that Black people face. It is
          taking action.

          We’ve been “objectified” and “commodified” by people who have
          re-worked our narratives, our culture, to their advantage. I believe
          now is the time to place the story, of the culture, back into the
          hands of the culture. All of my documentaries are solely dedicated to
          fighting for this, and only this. And that is something I am
          constantly working toward and something I wake up everyday with intent
          to do. To Fight. Fight for my truth, for my communities truth, for any
          marginalized communities truth. OUR truth will to be heard. “ - Talia
